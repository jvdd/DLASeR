# DLASeR

The code and the results of our paper: ["Applying Deep Learning to Reduce Large Adaptation Spaces of Self-Adaptive Systems with Multiple Types of Goals"](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~danny.weyns/papers/2020SEAMSa.pdf)


## Code

Cleaned up code comming soon!

## Results

The Jupyter notebooks containing the evaluation results are stored in the ```experiments/DLASeR/``` folder.


## Credits and citation

This project is created by [Jeroen Van Der Donckt](https://github.com/jvdd), [Federico Quin](https://github.com/FedericoQuin) and Danny Weyns.

We are grateful to all other people whose work laid the foundations of this project. 

We release our results and this code under MIT. 

Even though MIT doesn't require it, we would like to ask if you could nevertheless cite our paper if it helped you!
